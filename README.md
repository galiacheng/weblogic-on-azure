# Weblogic on Azure
This repository shows how to deploy a Java EE application to Azure using WebLogic and Linux virtual machines. The repository hosts the demos for this [talk](abstract.md) or [this](lab-abstract.md) lab.

The basic Java EE application used throughout is in the [javaee](/javaee) folder. You should set up and explore this application on your local machine.

The scenarios demonstrated include:

* Deploying a Java EE application on Azure using a simple instance of WebLogic using a marketplace solution. The [simple](/simple) folder shows how this is done.
* Deploying a Java EE application on Azure into a WebLogic cluster using a marketplace solution. The [cluster](/cluster) folder shows how this is done.

The demos use Java EE 7, Maven, Eclipse and PostgreSQL.
